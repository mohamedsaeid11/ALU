# ALU
Using github as a team each got tasks that gotta work it out here and afterwards we check what have we done 
Here we show the steps of each process 
first of all we design the sub modules like shift & logic & arthmtic & comapre units 
u gotta verify that each submodule is working right u can also make a self checking test bench testing it 
after that maybe we wanna do 1 job at a time so we gonna use the decoder and depending on the control signal we can decide what operation gonna happend 
for me as mohamed i gotta intergrate all these sub modules into the top module and make a testbench for it
